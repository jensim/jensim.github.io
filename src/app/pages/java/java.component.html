  I consider myself a polyglot developer.<br>
  I think Kotlin is the language im most at home in. It makes sense.<br>
  Java is "home country". But, I feel like I've outgrown it.<br>

  My Latest addition to the pile. Currently in use, and development.<br>
  Aims to address both ends of batch changes in code. Making and Receiving.<br>
  Leverage this IntelliJ-plugin to search, update, pull request, approve, merge, comment, modify..<br>
  The list goes on.<br>
  <b>Pull request fatigue</b> is a word that came up a lot when I started working with batch changes, Renovate and SourceGraph Batch Changes.<br>
  The goal is then, addressing the receiving side of batch changes, to make it as easy to receive the changes as it is to generate them.
