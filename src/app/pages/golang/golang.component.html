  GoLang
</h1>
<p>
  GoLang doesn't have as nice a syntax as Kotlin dues, but it's miles ahead in community and echo system.<br>
  Im currently just learning some GoLang for the joy of it.<br>
  Considering I probably will never take another "Java" job, GoLang might be the next big thing for me..

  No open source projects yet built in GoLang.
